<Intro>
A **symbol** is an identifier representing a named mathematical object. It 
may have a type and may hold a value. A symbol without a value represents a
mathematical unknown in an expression.
</Intro>

**To change the value or type of a symbol**, use the `value` and `type`
properties of the symbol.

A symbol does not have to be declared before it can be used. The type of a
symbol will be inferred based on its usage or its value.

```live show-line-numbers
const n = ce.box("n");
n.value = 5;
console.log("n =", n.value, ": ", n.type);
```

**To get a list of all the symbols in an expression** use `expr.symbols`.

## Scope

Symbols are defined within a **scope**.

## Unknowns and Constants

A symbol that has been declared, but has no values associated with it, is said
to be an **unknown**.

A symbol whose value cannot be changed is a **constant**. Constants are
identified by a special flag in their definition.

**To check if a symbol is a constant**, use the `expr.isConstant` property.

```js
console.log(ce.box("x").isConstant);
// ➔ false

console.log(ce.box("Pi").isConstant);
// ➔ true
```
:::warning

The value of constants may depend on settings of the Compute Engine. For
example, the value of `Pi` is determined based on the value of the `precision`
property. The values of constants in scope when the `precision` setting is
changed will be updated.

:::

```js
ce.precision = 4;
const smallPi = ce.box("Pi"); // π with 4 digits
console.log(smallPi.latex);
// ➔ 3.1415

ce.precision = 10;
const bigPi = ce.box("Pi"); // π with 10 digits
console.log(bigPi.latex);
// ➔ 3.1415926535

ce.precision = 100; // Future computations will be done with 100 digits

console.log("pi = ", smallPi, "=", bigPi);
// ➔ pi  = 3.1415 = 3.1415926535
```

## Automatic Declaration of Symbols

An unknown symbol is automatically declared when it is first used in an
expression.

The new definition has a domain of `undefined` and no value associated with it,
so the symbol will be an **unknwon**.

```js
const symbol = ce.box("m"); // m for mystery
console.log(symbol.domain);
// ➔ undefined

symbol.value = 5;
console.log(symbol);
// ➔ 5
```

## Forgetting a Symbol

**To _reset_ what is known about a symbol** use the `ce.forget()` function.

The `ce.forget()` function will remove any
[assumptions](/compute-engine/guides/assumptions) associated with a symbol, and
remove its value. Howeve, the symbol will remained declared, since other
expressions may depend on it.

**To forget about a specific symbol**, pass the name of the symbol as an
argument to `ce.forget()`.

**To forget about all the symbols in the current scope**, use `ce.forget()`
without any arguments.

:::info[Note]
Note that only symbols in the current scope are forgotten. If assumptions about
the symbol existed in a previous scope, those assumptions will be in effect when
returning to the previous scope.
